If we were simply calling print(), we would get the output each time we ran the print function. However, since the code in \"this\" only runs on import, and the module is cached once imported, calling import this again after this is already in the namespace doesn't do anything, and we don't get any output. We can fix that using the importlib module of the standard library."

But while the \"this\" module does use print() internally to print the poem to the console, we don't want to have to edit the source code of \"this\". A workaround is to temporarily redirect *all* standard output, which normally goes to the console in the case of print(), to another location, in this case a file of our choosing. We can do that with contextlib.redirect_stdout from the standard library.\n",
